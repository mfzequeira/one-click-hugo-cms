blurb:
  heading: " What is colorometry?"
  text: The idea of expressing music geometrically is ancient. Nature is well
    known for its connection with geometry. These and all other possible
    applications of geometry made me think that color should  conform to
    geometry as well. I decided to call my quest to find the connection
    colorometry because it combines color and geometry.
intro:
  heading: What I have so far.
  text: "I only use primary and secondary colors. Their numbers (3 and 3) and
    combinations seem to fit well into the symbols and shapes. The other thing I
    know is that I am just starting, there is a lot to do, but I hope to
    continue finding clues in my studies that get me closer to the goal. "

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
